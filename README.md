# rblx-general-scripts
Roblox scripts for general use (or specific games, the script itself will tell you). To be used with a script executor, such as Synapse. I did not make the majority of these myself though I do maintain them.

Set up an Issue if there is an error with the code. I don't have a script injector so some of these will be untested.

Some of the originals come from an archive run by the group Code Corp, visit https://www.roblox.com/groups/3666208/Code-Corp to join and https://discord.gg/DZ8SaVp for the discord.
